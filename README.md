# Symfony OpenTelemetry client Bundle
This bundle provides configured official otel bundle for Symfony application under the hood.
In addition, it provides a general way to configure telemetry collection via configuration list of Kernel listeners.

## Setup bundle
Enable bundle in your Symfony application:
```php
return [
    Macpaw\SymfonyOtelBundle\SymfonyOtelBundle::class => ['all' => true],
    // ...
];
```

## Configuration understanding
This bundle is a decoration under [https://github.com/opentelemetry-php/contrib-sdk-bundle](https://github.com/opentelemetry-php/contrib-sdk-bundle) to simplify integration with the official bundle and provide generic kernel listeners for data tracing.
If you want to get more information about configuration, please refer to the official bundle documentation.

## Setup bundle

## Kernel event listeners
Example of kernel event listener implementation can be found in `Macpaw\SymfonyOtelBundle\Span\ExecutionTimeSpanTracer` class.
When specific listener need to be configured, you need to add it to `span_tracers` list in configuration after implementation.
